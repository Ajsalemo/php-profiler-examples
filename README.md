# php-profiler-examples

Some examples of using various PHP profiler or debug tools. Each folder contains a `README.md` with steps on how use and/or enable the tool. These examples are primarily either using Laravel, or no framework. Aside from **Laravel Debug Bar**, these profilers and/or debuggers should generally work regardless of framework/library choice.
