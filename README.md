# php-profiler-examples

Some examples of using various PHP profiler or debug tools. Each folder contains a README with steps on how use and/or enable the tool. These examples are primarily using Laravel, or basic PHP. Aside from **Laravel Debug Bar**, these profilers and/or debuggers should generally work regardless of framework/library choice.
